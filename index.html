        <h1>Week 8: May 22 - 26</h1>
        <p>This was a roller coaster week for me. On Monday, we did a code along with Music History. We added Firebase to the project and made a complete CRUD application. CRUD means Create, Replace, Update and Delete. This is what we need for our mid-term capstones so this was a very important code along.</p><br>
        Then, beginning on Tuesday, we were placed into groups and began the Movie assignment. We had to incorporate everything that we were shown in the Music History code along. As usual, I felt like the underdog in our group. You'd think I'd be used to it by now, but I'm not. It boggles my mind about how much my classmates know compared to me.<p></p><br>
        <p>We worked as a group until Friday afternoon when we presented our projects. I think one team out of five had everything completed so I didn't feel too bad.</p>
        <p>Twice during this Movie group project, the assignment changed. The first time, they added a couple of different things. And then, the second time, they changed all of our code. Well, not changed, we just had to give our code to another team and in turn, we got another teams code. It simulated what will probably happen in the "real world".</p>

        <h1>Week 7: May 15 - 19</h1>
        <p>Probably one of my better weeks thus far. We started Monday morning dividing into groups of 5 and working on a new project. And when I say new, I mean no other class has done this project before. It was called Theme Park and we had to essentially divide a theme park into 5 different areas or themes. For each area, we had to have the attractions that made up that particular area. It was hard, but interesting at the same time.</p><br><p></p>

      <h1>Week 6: May 8 - 12</h1>
        <p>We started the week with some instruction on JQuery. This seems to be something that I'll be able to use with understanding.</p><br><p>Another week in the books. This week, we had a lot of lecture. we went over Browserify, which I really, really don't like. Maybe because I haven't used it, I don't know.?</p>
        <p>We also studied about Promises. I watched the Steve video and I understand why we would use it, but I don't think at this point in my process, this is something I should jump into. To say I've done it is the only reason that I can see.</p>
        <p>We also went over Handlebars which was kinda cool. I can see myself using that.</p><br>
        <p>We finished the week with Firebase. This is something that really makes sense and is something I belive I'll be able to use</p><br>

      <h1>Week 5: May 1 - May 5</h1>
          <p>Crazy week. We started Monday by seperating into groups for the "Chatty" exercise. I was really apprehensive at first, especially when I was named team lead. This was my second time being team lead. I'm not a good leader, especially when it comes to something I don't know that much about. How am I su[posed to lead when the people I lead know more than I do? Anyway, i did the best I could.</p>
          <p>The "Chatty" exercise was an app that utilizes IIFE's. For some reason, I could not get my head wrapped around IIFE's. Of course, I begin to panic.</p>
          <p>We spend Monday morning planning on a white board. After lunch, we decided to try and start putting code down, but it didn't take long to realize that we needed more planning.</p>
          <p>We spend most of Tuesday writing code, getting help, planning more, etc.</p>
          <p>Wednesday, we actually finished the project and played around with another exercise. We presented our project on Thursday and spend the rest of the day learning about Grunt and ignore files. Friday is a lab day and I've spend most of the day working on the Sandwich Maker exercise. I plan to try to finish it and begin work on the milestone challenge. I looked at it and made some templates but that's about it.</p>
          <p>Another week in the books!</p>

      <h1>Week 4: April 24 - 28</h1>
        <p>The week is starting off well. We began a new project on Tuesday. All of us on the team seem to be close to the same level. I need to continue with the exercises. They seem to be really helping me.</p>
        <p>I'm starting to have some fun. If I could stop worrying about how I'm progressing...</p>
        <p>Today is Friday, April 28. I learned a lot this week. Lets see if I can remember everything...</p><p>I know that I forgot to mention in an earlier blog that I know and understand Git and Git Hub so much more than before. I feel comfortable navigating around.</p><br>
        <p>We started IIFE's this week. I kinda understand them, at least I think I do. I have issues transfering that knowledge to my hands. I think it'll eventually sink in. </p>

      <h1>Week 3: April 17 - 21</h1>
        <p>New week: waiting for things to happen so I can populate it here.</p>
        <p>This week, I learned a lot about event listeners and get element by id's, etc. Mid-week, I turned in my first milestone challenge. Even though I wasn't sure if it was correct, it was. I need to get more confidence.</p>

      <h1>Week 2: April 10 - 14</h1>
        <p>The start of week two. I'm very optimistic. Ready to learn. We start the week by digging into javaScript. A lot more makes sense to me than it did the first time around. Actually completing the pre-work makes a hugh difference. I just hope I can retain the info and apply it to my work.</p>
        <p>What I learned this week? When you push your files in GitHub, there has to be actual info inside a folder for it to be pushed up. You can't just have a folder such as main.js or info.html. I am also much more confident using GitHub than I was before. I never could wrap my head around it before and now I feel like I understand it. Not all of it but more than before.</p>

      <h1>Week 1: April 3 - 7</h1>
        <p>So begins the 19th Cohort at Nashville Software School. As this is my second go around having been a member of Cohort 15, I was somewhat nervous. I knew what to expect and I had completed all of the pre-work assignments, however, I was afraid of not being able to keep up with all the younger students.</p>
        <p>Monday was a day for orientation and for getting everyone's computers up to speed. Tuesday was a day for watching Cohort 18's mid-capstone projects. Wednesday is when it all really started to happen. We began by coding along to a simple webpage. Thursday, we touched on HTML and CSS but we finished the day with an intro to JavaScript. JavaScript is where I really fell behind last time. I was optimistic, excited. Friday, we ended with a lab day to start/catch-up on our pre-work and exercises.</p>
        <p>What I learned this week? To keep pushing ahead. Complete the exercises. Not to worry. Do what I can. Ask questions when needed.</p><br>
