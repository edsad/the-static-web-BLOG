      <h1>Week 5: May 1 - May 5</h1>
          <p>Crazy week. We started Monday by seperating into groups for the "Chatty" exercise. I was really apprehensive at first, especially when I was named team lead. This was my second time being team lead. I'm not a good leader, especially when it comes to something I don't know that much about. How am I su[posed to lead when the people I lead know more than I do? Anyway, i did the best I could.</p>
          <p>The "Chatty" exercise was an app that utilizes IIFE's. For some reason, I could not get my head wrapped around IIFE's. Of course, I begin to panic.</p>
          <p>We spend Monday morning planning on a white board. After lunch, we decided to try and start putting code down, but it didn't take long to realize that we needed more planning.</p>
          <p>We spend most of Tuesday writing code, getting help, planning more, etc.</p>
          <p>Wednesday, we actually finished the project and played around with another exercise. We presented our project on Thursday and spend the rest of the day learning about Grunt and ignore files. Friday is a lab day and I've spend most of the day working on the Sandwich Maker exercise. I plan to try to finish it and begin work on the milestone challenge. I looked at it and made some templates but that's about it.</p>
          <p>Another week in the books!</p>

      <h1>Week 4: April 24 - 28</h1>
        <p>The week is starting off well. We began a new project on Tuesday. All of us on the team seem to be close to the same level. I need to continue with the exercises. They seem to be really helping me.</p>
        <p>I'm starting to have some fun. If I could stop worrying about how I'm progressing...</p>
        <p>Today is Friday, April 28. I learned a lot this week. Lets see if I can remember everything...</p><p>I know that I forgot to mention in an earlier blog that I know and understand Git and Git Hub so much more than before. I feel comfortable navigating around.</p><br>
        <p>We started IIFE's this week. I kinda understand them, at least I think I do. I have issues transfering that knowledge to my hands. I think it'll eventually sink in. </p>

      <h1>Week 3: April 17 - 21</h1>
        <p>New week: waiting for things to happen so I can populate it here.</p>
        <p>This week, I learned a lot about event listeners and get element by id's, etc. Mid-week, I turned in my first milestone challenge. Even though I wasn't sure if it was correct, it was. I need to get more confidence.</p>

      <h1>Week 2: April 10 - 14</h1>
        <p>The start of week two. I'm very optimistic. Ready to learn. We start the week by digging into javaScript. A lot more makes sense to me than it did the first time around. Actually completing the pre-work makes a hugh difference. I just hope I can retain the info and apply it to my work.</p>
        <p>What I learned this week? When you push your files in GitHub, there has to be actual info inside a folder for it to be pushed up. You can't just have a folder such as main.js or info.html. I am also much more confident using GitHub than I was before. I never could wrap my head around it before and now I feel like I understand it. Not all of it but more than before.</p>

      <h1>Week 1: April 3 - 7</h1>
        <p>So begins the 19th Cohort at Nashville Software School. As this is my second go around having been a member of Cohort 15, I was somewhat nervous. I knew what to expect and I had completed all of the pre-work assignments, however, I was afraid of not being able to keep up with all the younger students.</p>
        <p>Monday was a day for orientation and for getting everyone's computers up to speed. Tuesday was a day for watching Cohort 18's mid-capstone projects. Wednesday is when it all really started to happen. We began by coding along to a simple webpage. Thursday, we touched on HTML and CSS but we finished the day with an intro to JavaScript. JavaScript is where I really fell behind last time. I was optimistic, excited. Friday, we ended with a lab day to start/catch-up on our pre-work and exercises.</p>
        <p>What I learned this week? To keep pushing ahead. Complete the exercises. Not to worry. Do what I can. Ask questions when needed.</p>
