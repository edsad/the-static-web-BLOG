      <h1>Week 2: April 10 - 14</h1>
        <p>The start of week two. I'm very optimistic. Ready to learn. We start the week by digging into javaScript. A lot more makes sense to me than it did the first time around. Actually completing the pre-work makes a hugh difference. I just hope I can retain the info and apply it to my work.</p>
        <p>What I learned this week? When you push your files in GitHub, there has to be actual info inside a folder for it to be pushed up. You can't just have a folder such as main.js or info.html. I am also much more confident using GitHub than I was before. I never could wrap my head around it before and now I feel like I understand it. Not all of it but more than before.</p>

      <h1>Week 1: April 3 - 7</h1>
        <p>So begins the 19th Cohort at Nashville Software School. As this is my second go around having been a member of Cohort 15, I was somewhat nervous. I knew what to expect and I had completed all of the pre-work assignments, however, I was afraid of not being able to keep up with all the younger students.</p>
        <p>Monday was a day for orientation and for getting everyone's computers up to speed. Tuesday was a day for watching Cohort 18's mid-capstone projects. Wednesday is when it all really started to happen. We began by coding along to a simple webpage. Thursday, we touched on HTML and CSS but we finished the day with an intro to JavaScript. JavaScript is where I really fell behind last time. I was optimistic, excited. Friday, we ended with a lab day to start/catch-up on our pre-work and exercises.</p>
        <p>What I learned this week? To keep pushing ahead. Complete the exercises. Not to worry. Do what I can. Ask questions when needed.</p>
